# AI-Powered Resume Analysis and Job Matching

This project analyzes candidate resumes using AI and provides an efficient way to match resumes with job descriptions, extract candidate information, and generate interview questions. The system uses AutoGenâ€™s agent functionality where two agents collaborate to provide the most relevant match score. We also use Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features
- **Resume Analysis:** Extracts education, experience, achievements, contact details, and skills from resumes.
- **Job Match Score:** Compares the job description with the resume and calculates a match percentage.
- **Skill-Based Interview Questions:** Allows recruiters to generate interview questions for specific skills and provides model-generated answers.
- **Candidate Summary:** Summarizes key information from the resume.

## Technologies Used
